### Symbology

When looking at the firefigher's wildfire maps the symbols are defined in PMS 936 for [Point](https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms936/symbology/point), [Line](https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms936/symbology/line), and [Polygon](https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms936/symbology/polygon)

There's a good verbal description of symbols you'll see on the map in [this video at 297 seconds](https://youtu.be/VsfBln5-Xak?t=297)

## Air Quality
